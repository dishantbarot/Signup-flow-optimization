# Sign-Up Flow Optimization Dashboard  

## üìå Executive Summary  
This project analyzes the **sign-up and login conversion funnel** of a digital platform using Tableau. The dashboard and accompanying report uncover where users experience friction in the registration process, identify error patterns across devices and sign-up methods, and highlight actionable strategies to improve conversion rates.  

## ‚ùì Business Problem  
The platform seeks to **increase the pool of free registered users** as a pathway to paid conversions. However, sign-up and login failures reduce the overall visitor-to-free conversion rate. The challenge is to identify **where and why users drop off**, and recommend optimizations to improve onboarding success and long-term revenue growth.  

## üî¨ Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Extracted visitor, sign-up, and login event data.  
   - Cleaned and modeled datasets for Tableau analysis.  

2. **Dashboard Design in Tableau**  
   - Story 1: Visitor-to-Signup Conversions by Device & OS.  
   - Story 2: Signup Types & Error Patterns.  
   - Story 3: Login Types & Common Failures.  

3. **Analysis**  
   - Compared success/failure rates by platform, device, and method.  
   - Investigated error logs (e.g., invalid credentials, closed pop-ups).  
   - Quantified impact of changes on conversion and revenue.  

## üõ† Skills  
- Data Visualization (Tableau)  
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Funnel and Conversion Analysis  
- Storytelling with Data  
- Business Analytics & Optimization  

## üìà Results and Business Recommendations  
- **Key Findings**  
  - Mobile sign-ups fail nearly 3x more than desktop (3.24% vs 1.16%).  
  - Google has the highest success rate (91%), while email has the lowest (65%).  
  - Facebook shows frequent ‚Äúunknown‚Äù errors; LinkedIn performs better with fewer errors.  
  - Top login issue: *Invalid email or password* with **40,000+ occurrences**.  

- **Business Recommendations**  
  - Emphasize **social sign-up options** (Google, LinkedIn) on the registration page.  
  - Simplify the **email sign-up flow** (fewer fields, relaxed password rules).  
  - Improve **password restoration and error messaging**.  
  - Investigate recurring **Facebook unknown errors**.  

## üöÄ Next Steps  
- A/B test **highlighted social login buttons** to measure conversion lift.  
- Roll out **mobile-optimized sign-up forms** to reduce email entry errors.  
- Track **long-term conversion uplift** from free ‚Üí paid subscriptions.  
- Extend analysis with **user cohort tracking** (e.g., retention by sign-up type).
